#  fix my speaker
My loudspeaker seems to have some electrical affair, _I believe_. 

Whenever itâ€™s not playing audio, a humming noise is present. However, when normal audio output occurs, the humming disappears. This script generates an inaudible 440 Hz sine wave tone. It uses an 8 kHz sample rate (telephone-quality audio) and a low refresh rate while loop to minimize CPU consumption.
