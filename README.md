# fix my speaker

My loadspeaker is having some electricity affair whenever not playing audio the humming is present but when normal audio output it disappears so this python script generate a inaudible 440 hz frequency tone sinewave. Using 8Khz (telephone) as sample rate and low refresh rate while loop to minimize CPU consumption.
